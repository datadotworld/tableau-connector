## General

* Contributions of all kinds (issues, ideas, proposals), not just code, are highly appreciated.
* Pull requests are welcome with the understanding that major changes will be carefully evaluated 
and discussed, and may not always be accepted. Starting with a discussion is always best!
* All contributions including documentation, filenames and discussions should be written in English language.
